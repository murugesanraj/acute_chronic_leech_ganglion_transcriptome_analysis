# acute_chronic_leech_ganglion_transcriptome_analysis
Transcriptome analysis of the leech ganglion uses RNA-Seq to profile the CNS during injury and repair. Acute analysis captures early immune and signaling responses, while chronic profiling reveals mechanisms of long-term synaptic recovery. This identifies DEGs that drive the leech's unique ability to regenerate neural connections.
